               <p class="paragraph">The rifle felt cold against my cheek as I peered through the scope. A clear night stretched above me, stars flickering in the darkness, the faint breeze the only movement in the quiet. If it were any other night, I'd probably be sipping a cheap energy drink, watching crowds from a balcony somewhere. But not tonight.</p>
               <p class="paragraph">Tonight, I lay flat on my stomach, my finger resting lightly on the trigger, my eyes fixed on the judge inside the hotel room below. He was slouched on the edge of his bed, half his shirt undone, belt dangling loosely from his pants. His fingers toyed with the edge of a glass, but I couldn’t make out what he was drinking. His posture screamed impatience. He was waiting for someone, and judging by the way his gaze kept darting to the door, my guess was a mistress or a hooker. His wife, I knew, was miles away in his home state. My client had made it clear—no witnesses.</p>
               <p class="paragraph">The door creaked open, and through the scope, I caught the flicker of a woman entering the room. She moved with an unhurried grace, her face shadowed by the brim of a wide hat, an oversized trench coat obscuring her form. The judge perked up, his hand darting into a drawer before slapping down a thick wad of cash onto the bed. The woman shrugged off her coat, and underneath, there wasn’t much left to the imagination. As her hands began to roam the judge’s body, I steadied my breath, aligning the crosshairs to the back of his head. One shot. Two kills. No wasted bullets.</p>
               <p class="paragraph">They leaned into each other, lips inches apart, oblivious to the death aimed at them from the darkness. I inhaled deeply, the cold air sharp in my lungs. “Sorry about this,” I murmured under my breath.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">The trigger clicked. The rifle jerked.</p>
               <p class="paragraph">A soft thud.</p>
                
                 <p class="paragraph">Through the scope, I watched the judge’s head slump forward, landing between the woman’s breasts, her face frozen in shock as blood sprayed across the wall behind them. They crumpled together, lifeless, still tangled in each other’s arms. Perfect. They never saw it coming.</p>
               <p class="paragraph">I didn’t rush. There was no need. No one would find them until morning when room service arrived with breakfast. Still, I moved methodically, disassembling my rifle and packing it into my suitcase, scanning the rooftop for any sign of my presence. My fingers brushed against the empty shell casing in my pocket. Satisfied, I zipped the case shut and slipped into the nigh</p>
               <p class="paragraph">As I stepped onto the crowded street, the buzz of the city hit me like a wave. Laughter, car horns, the clatter of heels on the pavement—so many lives happening all at once, none of them aware of the death that had just unfolded above their heads.</p>
               <p class="paragraph">I activated my phone with a quick swipe, typed out a single word: done. Then switched it off, the satisfaction settling in. The money would come; it always did. The talking heads would have their field day, the papers would run their stories, and I’d disappear into the hum of the city, just another ghost among the noise.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">A smile crept across my face as I removed my mask, the world around me turning into a blur of motion and sound. I melted into the crowd, a phantom in the grey, carried away by the symphony of the night.</p>
