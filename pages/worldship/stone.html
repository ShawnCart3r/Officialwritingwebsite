                        “So, how’s life with civilians? I’ve always found it so exhausting,” Aryanna asked as she cleaned her shotgun. Though she appeared to be in the room physically and could interact with parts of Veronica’s room, Zora wasn’t there. The shock trooper was on a separate cruiser, The Valor. Aryanna's focus surprised Veronica.  The trooper was checking every nook and cranny for any blemish. Satisfied for the time being, Aryanna placed the gun, muzzle down, on her side, and looked up at Veronica. “They gave you the queen suite. Knowing you, I doubt you asked for such a placement,” Veronica chuckled as she hung up her clothes. Aryanna was right of course. She would never have requested such a large room for herself. As the humanitarian of the Originals, she always felt the need to be amongst the people. It was a trait some of her comrades found annoying and a few found laudable. She didn’t care either way. From Veronica’s viewpoint, she was the only thing keeping her compatriots still human in these inhumane times. It was a burden she alone held.

                    <p class="paragraph">
“They gave you the queen suite, huh?” Aryanna smirked. “Bet you didn’t ask for it.”


                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                     Veronica snorted as she hung her jacket, the fabric swaying slightly from the motion. “Of course not. You know me.”

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="Aryanna raised an eyebrow. “I do. That’s why I’m surprised you’re even here, in this palace of a room.”


                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        
                        Veronica shrugged, brushing a stray hair behind her ear. “It was ready when I got here. Seemed rude to turn it down.” She busied herself folding her clothes, but she felt Aryanna's gaze drilling into her.

                    <p class="Veronica shrugged, brushing a stray hair behind her ear. “It was ready when I got here. Seemed rude to turn it down.” She busied herself folding her clothes, but she felt Aryanna's gaze drilling into her.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        “What’s got you all... upbeat?” Aryanna’s tone was laced with suspicion, that habitual edge she picked up from her mentor.


                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       Veronica suppressed a grin, biting her lip as she placed her boots by the bed. “I’m heading to the hospital bay in a few. They’re calling it ‘state-of-the-art.’ Can’t wait to see if it’s true.”

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        
Aryanna scoffed, her armored fingers tapping restlessly on her thigh. “Leave it to you to get excited over a hospital bay. You should be up at the command center, taking command.”


                    </p>
                    <p class="Veronica felt Aryanna’s intensity, even through the projection. The trooper’s fist clenched, as if she could bend the universe to her will with sheer force of personality. Veronica shook her head, suppressing a laugh. Classic Aryanna, always ready for a fight, even when there was none to be had.


                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       “I could.” Veronica’s voice was soft, knowing. “But I won’t.”


                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      
“You never want it, do you?” Aryanna’s lip curled, but there was a begrudging admiration in her eyes. “You’d rather be down here, healing the sick and rescuing the forgotten. Admirable... if a bit frustrating
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
Veronica stopped folding for a moment, her hands still. “I prefer to leave the power games to people who care about them. Now, what do you want, Aryanna? You didn’t call just to chat.”

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
Aryanna’s smirk faded, replaced by a hardened expression. “Theresa needs you to find a system for the refugees. You know how it goes. The core worlds don’t want them, and the outer systems are basically Persephone’s playground now.”
