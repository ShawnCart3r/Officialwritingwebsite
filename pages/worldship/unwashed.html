                       Veronica stepped out of her quarters, her thoughts a tangled mix of frustration and purpose. She had contacted the bridge earlier and learned that the captain had just left for the food court. That’s where she was headed now. As she walked through the sterile metal halls, she was struck by how empty they were—cold, barren, and devoid of life. The quiet was unsettling, but it wasn’t surprising. Refugees weren’t permitted on this deck. Only the wealthy and powerful had access. Even in times of crisis, the hierarchy remained intact. The thought twisted something deep inside her. It wasn’t her place to change it, though. She was a doctor, nothing more.


                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       When she reached the elevator, Veronica pressed the button and leaned back as the doors closed. The soft, bland music filled the space. Annoying as it was, she let it distract her. It was better than the thoughts swirling in her mind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       The doors slid open with a soft hiss, and Veronica stepped back, startled. A wave of sound hit her, the low hum of voices, a cacophony of bodies filling the cramped space. People were everywhere. She hadn’t seen this many on the ship before. Where were they hiding all these people? she wondered as she began weaving her way through the throng. As she moved, her eyes caught sight of a little girl, sitting alone in the middle of the crowd. She clutched a worn teddy bear, missing an eye, and her small face was crumpling with unshed tears.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       As the elevator doors slid open, the noise hit her like a wave. A crowd filled the space, people jammed together in every corner. Where the hell did all these people come from? she wondered, as she pushed her way through, avoiding elbows and shoulders. That’s when she saw her—a little girl, sitting on the floor clutching a tattered teddy bear. The girl’s eyes darted around the room, lost, scared.



                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Veronica moved toward her, but someone bumped into her hard.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       
“Watch it, lady!” a man snapped, not even looking at her.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                     Veronica turned, locking eyes with him. His clothes were filthy, his hair a mess, and he smelled like he hadn’t seen soap in days. His hand gripped her shoulder.

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      “Let go,” she said, her voice steady.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
The man hesitated, but didn’t back off. Veronica grabbed his wrist and twisted. The crack of his bones was met with a gasp as he dropped to his knees, clutching his arm in pain.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       
“Please,” he whispered, his voice cracking.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                    Veronica leaned in, her eyes cold. “Next time, think before you touch someone.”


                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      She released him, and he stumbled back into the crowd, holding his arm close. The room had gone quiet, everyone watching her now. She hadn’t wanted to draw attention, but here she was, the center of it all.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Ignoring the stares, she turned back to the little girl, who was watching her wide-eyed. The tears were gone, replaced with something close to wonder. Veronica knelt beside her.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        “Where are your parents?” she asked, her voice softening.


                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       The girl hugged her teddy bear tighter but didn’t answer. Just as Veronica was about to ask again, a voice cut in from behind.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       “They didn’t make it off-world,” a harsh feminine voice replied.

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                     Veronica stood up and turned to see a young woman approaching. She had the same disheveled look as the girl, though she’d made an effort to clean up. Her brunette hair was tied back, but the look in her green eyes was what caught Veronica’s attention—anger and something darker.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
“I’m Veronica,” she said, offering her hand.
                        
                    </p>
                      <p class="paragraph">
                     The woman looked at it for a second before shaking. Her grip was firm, her eyes sharp. “Rebecca. And that’s my sister, Kerry.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       Veronica glanced back at the little girl. “I’m sorry about your parents.”

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      Rebecca shrugged, her face hard. “Doesn’t matter. Shadows don’t care about people like us, anyway.”
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       Veronica sighed. She’d heard it all before, but it still stung. “I’m not here because of that.”



                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      Rebecca gave a bitter laugh. “Right. You’re just here to help.” She glanced over at Kerry, who was now looking around, clearly distracted by the crowd.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                     “Yeah,” Veronica said, her voice flat. “I am.”

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                     Rebecca’s eyes narrowed, studying her. Then, without another word, she bent down and picked up her sister, who clutched her bear even tighter.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      “I’ve got to find somewhere for her to rest,” Rebecca said, her tone softening as she looked at her sister. “You said you were meeting the captain?”
                      </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Veronica nodded. “Supposed to. I was headed to the food court, but I guess I hit the wrong deck.”
</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Rebecca smirked. “Figures. Why would someone like you end up down here?”

</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Veronica’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. “People like me get bored of people like them.”
</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Rebecca stared at her for a moment, then shook her head. “We’re not looking for your pity, Shadow.”</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">“I’m not offering any.”</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Rebecca glanced at her, a flicker of surprise in her eyes. “Maybe. Doesn’t change much though, does it?”
</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Rebecca shifted her sister to her other hip. “Well, good luck with the captain.”</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Veronica nodded. “Take care of your sister.”</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Rebecca didn’t answer, just gave a brief nod and disappeared into the crowd, her sister’s bear bobbing along behind her.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Rebecca didn’t answer, just gave a brief nod and disappeared into the crowd, her sister’s bear bobbing along behind her.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">“They think they’re better than us, don’t they?” A voice cut through his thoughts</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Blake looked up to see a woman standing a few feet away. She was tall, her long hair loose over her shoulders. She wore a tank top and ripped jeans, her eyes gleaming as they locked onto his.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">“Yeah, they do,” he spat, the anger bubbling up again.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">The woman stepped closer, her hand brushing his good arm. “They aren’t. In fact, I’d say they’re worse than us. But together, we could show them. Show them what we’re capable of.”
</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Blake’s heart pounded, the pain in his arm fading under her touch. For the first time in a long while, he felt something stir inside him. Something he hadn’t felt in years.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">He looked up at her, his voice low. “Yeah. Let’s do that.”</p>
