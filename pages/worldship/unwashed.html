                       Veronica stepped out of her quarters, her thoughts a tangled mix of frustration and purpose. She had contacted the bridge earlier and learned that the captain had just left for the food court. That’s where she was headed now. As she walked through the sterile metal halls, she was struck by how empty they were—cold, barren, and devoid of life. The quiet was unsettling, but it wasn’t surprising. Refugees weren’t permitted on this deck. Only the wealthy and powerful had access. Even in times of crisis, the hierarchy remained intact. The thought twisted something deep inside her. It wasn’t her place to change it, though. She was a doctor, nothing more.


                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       When she reached the elevator, Veronica pressed the button and leaned back as the doors closed. The soft, bland music filled the space. Annoying as it was, she let it distract her. It was better than the thoughts swirling in her mind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       The doors slid open with a soft hiss, and Veronica stepped back, startled. A wave of sound hit her, the low hum of voices, a cacophony of bodies filling the cramped space. People were everywhere. She hadn’t seen this many on the ship before. Where were they hiding all these people? she wondered as she began weaving her way through the throng. As she moved, her eyes caught sight of a little girl, sitting alone in the middle of the crowd. She clutched a worn teddy bear, missing an eye, and her small face was crumpling with unshed tears.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       As the elevator doors slid open, the noise hit her like a wave. A crowd filled the space, people jammed together in every corner. Where the hell did all these people come from? she wondered, as she pushed her way through, avoiding elbows and shoulders. That’s when she saw her—a little girl, sitting on the floor clutching a tattered teddy bear. The girl’s eyes darted around the room, lost, scared.



                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       
“Hey, lady! Watch it!” a man growled, his breath hot with anger.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      Veronica turned to face him. His appearance was disheveled—greasy clothes, unkempt hair, the sour stench of days without a shower. His hand was still on her shoulder. The sight of him stirred a cold fury in her chest, but her voice remained calm.
 

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      “Remove your hand,” Veronica’s red eyes locking onto his.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
The man hesitated, his bravado faltering under her gaze, but didn’t let go. With a swift motion, Veronica grabbed his wrist and twisted. The satisfying crack of bone was drowned out by his strangled cry of pain as he collapsed to his knees, clutching his arm.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       
“Please!” he gasped, tears spilling down his dirty cheeks.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      Veronica leaned closer, her voice low but unyielding. “Let that be a reminder.” She released him, and he scurried back, disappearing into the crowd. Silence fell over the room, and every eye was on her now. She had intended to remain unnoticed on this ship, but that chance was gone.  

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       Ignoring the stares, she turned back to the little girl, who was no longer crying. In fact, the child looked up at her with something close to awe. Veronica’s heart softened a fraction as she crouched down to the girl’s level.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        “Where are your parents?” she asked gently.


                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       The girl hugged her teddy bear tighter, eyes wide and fearful. Before the girl could respond, a voice came from behind.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       “They didn’t make it off-world.”

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      Veronica stood and turned. A young woman stood there, her clothes as ragged as the little girl’s, though she’d clearly made an effort to clean up. Her brunette hair was tied back messily, and her green eyes held a hardness that made Veronica pause. Those eyes told a story of loss and anger—a look Veronica recognized all too well.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
“I’m Veronica,” she said, extending a hand.
                        
                    </p>
                      <p class="paragraph">
                      The woman hesitated, then shook it. Her grip was firm, her gaze unwavering. “Rebecca. And that’s my sister, Kerry.” She nodded toward the little girl. 

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Veronica glanced back at Kerry, who was now preoccupied with watching the other adults. “I’m sorry about your parents,” Veronica said quietly.

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       Rebecca’s lips twisted into a bitter smile. “You think Shadows care about that? Your kind never has.”
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       The words stung, but Veronica didn’t flinch. She had heard it all before. “I’m just here to help,” she said, her voice even. 


                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       “Help,” Rebecca echoed with a hollow laugh. “Sure. I’m sure that’s what the Shadows think they’re doing while they destroy everything in their path.”

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       Veronica’s smile tightened. “Not all of us.” 

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      Rebecca snorted, her eyes full of skepticism, but she didn’t argue further. Instead, she lifted Kerry into her arms, and the little girl clutched her bear tightly, dangling it dangerously by its loose arm. With a slight movement of her hand, Veronica used her abilities to subtly secure the bear’s grip, ensuring it wouldn’t fall. Kerry giggled, oblivious to what had just happened.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Rebecca raised an eyebrow but said nothing. Instead, she shifted the conversation. “You said you were headed to meet the captain?”
                      </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">“Yeah, I got a little turned around,” Veronica admitted, scanning the room. “This isn’t exactly the food court.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Rebecca chuckled, though it was without warmth. “No, it’s not. You won’t find many captains mingling with ‘rejects.’” Her tone dripped with resentment.
</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Veronica sighed. “You know, society’s accepted are far less interesting than people give them credit for.”</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Rebecca stared at her for a moment, then shook her head. “We’re not looking for your pity, Shadow.”</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">“I’m not offering any.”</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">The two women exchanged a look, not of friendship, but of mutual understanding. Finally, Rebecca’s expression softened. “Well, good luck with your captain. I’ve got to get Kerry some rest.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Veronica gave a small nod. “It was nice talking to you, Rebecca. Take care of your sister.”</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Rebecca didn’t respond, simply turned and disappeared back into the sea of people, her little sister’s laughter the only thing trailing behind her.</p>
