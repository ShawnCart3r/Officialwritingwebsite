                <div class="content__story">
                     <p class="paragraph">The jungle pulsed with life, but Persephone found no comfort in its song. The thick air clung to her skin, and even as she wiped her forehead, sweat poured down again. She tugged at her cloak, hating how her hair trapped the heat. Only the sharpness of the air kept her from losing it entirely. She wasn’t made for this place.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">So, when the trees began to fall, she smiled. The grinding roar of her contagion engines swallowed the jungle's chorus. Smoke poured from their exhausts, choking the freshness out of the air. Treads crushed flora and fauna alike, uncaring. Soon, everything here would bow to her will.</p>
                         <p class="paragraph">Behind the engines, her decaying minions dragged themselves forward. Rotting flesh sagged from brittle bones, some barely able to crawl. A week in this humid hell had taken its toll. Persephone sighed, thankful the engines' noise drowned out their constant groaning. Without it, she’d have gone mad.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">The Sirens followed in silence. Armored in a patchwork of light and heavy gear, they moved through the debris, some smashing through fallen trees without a thought. Rifles rested on shoulders, swords hung loosely at their sides, but all were ready. Their silence was unsettling, but welcome.</p> 
                         <p class="paragraph">Persephone’s enemies, the Huskers, fought from the trees. They moved like shadows, ambushing from above. Soon, their brutes would charge, but she’d make sure it happened on her terms.
</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">A guttural roar cut through the din. A massive lizard, six feet tall, crashed down from a branch, locked in battle with a monstrous slicer. The slicer's claws dug deep into its arm, tail whipping in search of an opening. The lizard swung back with brute force, but the slicer held firm. Finally, its tail found its mark, impaling the lizard's stomach. In its dying moments, the Husker smashed the slicer's skull into the dirt, but more of Persephone’s carriers swarmed over the body, tearing it apart piece by piece.</p> 
                         <p class="paragraph">The Sirens, deadly precise, began picking off larger targets. With the Huskers' element of surprise fading, they leaped from the trees. Sirens fixed bayonets and drew power swords, their lines holding firm. Persephone, untouched, simply raised a hand, waiting for the enemy to make their fatal mistake.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Her rotting minions slowed the oncoming charge, though many were ripped apart in the process. Blood sprayed across the ground as the treetops burned. The first Huskers smashed into the Siren line, fists meeting steel. A Siren drove a bayonet through a lizard’s throat, only to be torn apart by another. In retaliation, the dead Siren’s comrade shattered the Husker’s spine with a power fist. Neither side gave an inch.</p> 
                         <p class="paragraph">In the heart of the battle, Persephone watched with detached interest. Her shield deflected shots, fists, and blades. She spotted a wounded Husker struggling to rise. With a flick of her wrist, she lifted it into the air. It writhed, its eyes wide with terror, as it watched its comrades fall around it. Before it could scream, she snapped its neck. The body dropped with a dull thud.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">“YOU WITCH!” a voice roared.</p> 
                         <p class="paragraph">She turned, locking eyes with a Husker lieutenant charging through the carnage. Its fist was inches from her face when it froze in mid-air. Persephone circled it slowly, running her fingers over its muscular arm</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">"You Huskers, always so proud of your strength," she whispered. "What are you without it?"
</p> 
                         <p class="paragraph">The Husker's eyes filled with panic as Persephone snapped its fingers, one by one. Bones twisted and cracked. It could only scream as its body collapsed to the ground, useless.
</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">The battlefield grew quiet. Her remaining carriers piled the dead into heaps, while the Sirens gathered the Husker corpses in neat rows. Persephone sat on a rock, surveying the aftermath. She had no time to raise each corpse individually, not with the main attack force likely on its way. With a sigh, she placed her hand on the ground and closed her eyes. A collective groan rose from the corpses as they reanimated, staring at her with dead, white eyes.</p> 
                         <p class="paragraph">Smiling, Persephone pointed toward the Huskers' base. Her new army of the dead followed without question, and she pressed forward, her conquest of the jungle world underway.</p>
