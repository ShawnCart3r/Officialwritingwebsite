                <div class="content__story">
                      <p class="paragraph">The event unfolded with barely a whisper. No explosion, no blinding light. It was too quiet, too controlled. Exactly the way Persephone wanted it. She stood on the command bridge, her fingers tracing the rim of a glass of red wine, eyes fixed on the stars. Her agents were already at work, stirring chaos in the shadows of unsuspecting worlds. Her fleets were poised, waiting for the right moment to strike.</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">Her lips curled into a smile. “We’ll show them what humanity really creates,” she murmured. “Nightmares.”</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">She raised the glass to her lips. “Life finds all.”</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">Sierra stood in the shadow of massive ships, their hulking forms blotting out the sun. The once peaceful sky was now a sea of metal, engines rumbling like distant thunder. She hadn’t seen anything like this in centuries. The sight sent a shiver down her spine, equal parts awe and dread. The front lines had fallen, forcing the middle systems to scramble. They’d cobbled this fleet together in a week—if you could call it that.</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">“They’ve got no idea what they’re doing,” she muttered to herself.</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">A crewman nearby glanced her way. “What was that?”</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">Sierra shook her head. “Nothing. Just… the numbers. It’s all falling apart.”</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">The crewman gave her a tight smile. “Yeah. The game’s just starting.”</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">Veronica watched as the boy hugged his family one last time. His father was stone-faced, his jaw tight with the effort of holding it together. His mother, though, wasn’t trying to be brave. Tears streamed down her face, her hands gripping his shoulders as though she could keep him anchored there.
</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">“Please, don’t go. You don’t have to prove anything,” the mother pleaded, her voice breaking.</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">The boy swallowed hard, looking at her, then his father. His little sister stood there, wide-eyed and clutching a toy, too young to understand what was happening. She just stared at her brother, confused by the tears, the goodbye.</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">“You could still stay,” Veronica whispered under her breath, her hand twitching toward him. But she stayed put.</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">“All aboard!” The quartermaster’s voice echoed through the air.
</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">The boy hesitated for a moment, looking back at his family. His father finally cracked, tears slipping down his face as his wife held him. The boy gave a small, desperate wave to his sister. Tears filled his eyes as he turned away and walked toward the ship.</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">Veronica watched him go, her heart heavy. “War is hell,” she muttered.</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">And he was just another soul lost to it.</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">Inside the transport, the heavy metal doors slid open, the noise outside a dull roar through the thick walls. Cassandra felt the hum of the ship beneath her boots, her heart pounding in her chest. She’d faced the Nightmares before, but this… this was going to be worse.</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">Next to her, Aryanna grinned behind her visor, her purple power armor gleaming. “Nervous?” she asked, her voice tinny through the helmet speaker.</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">“Yeah. You?” Cassandra replied, checking the safeties on her twin pistols.</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">“Always.” Aryanna cocked her shotgun. “But that’s what makes it fun, right?”</p>
                       <p class="paragraph">Cassandra gave a small laugh, though her hands were shaking. “Sure. Fun.”</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">Aryanna leaned in closer. “Don’t worry. Just follow my lead, and we’ll make it through. I’ve got your back.”</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">“Thanks. I’ll hold you to that.”</p> 
                       <p class="paragraph">Aryanna turned to the rest of the marines, raising her voice. “All right, you dogs, you know the drill! Let’s show these bastards what a real fight looks like!”</p> 
                      <p class="paragraph">The shadow marines roared in response, weapons at the ready. Cassandra took a deep breath and stepped forward, her pulse steadying. She didn’t know what awaited them outside, but whatever it was, she was ready to face it.</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">Teresa stood in front of the mirror, her helmet cradled in her arms. Her reflection stared back at her, the person she used to be slipping further away with each passing second. Once, she had been the Blue Saint, the one who fought to bring peace. Now, peace was a fantasy. A lie.
“How did it come to this?” she whispered, her voice barely more than a breath.
</p>
                       <p class="paragraph">She’d tried everything to stop the war, but all she’d done was accelerate it. Every move, every decision, had brought her closer to this moment. Alone. Angry. Her blue hair caught the dim light, but her eyes—her eyes were what had changed the most. Once soft, now they burned with a righteous fury.</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">She lifted her helmet and placed it over her head, the familiar weight settling onto her shoulders. In the reflection, she was no longer the Blue Saint.</p> 
                       <p class="paragraph">No, she was something darker. Something deadlier.</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">“Peace is a lie,” she muttered. “I should’ve seen it sooner.”</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">Her lips curled into a grim smile. “Annihilation it is, then</p>
                      <p class="paragraph">With that, she turned away from the mirror, her hands tightening into fists. The galaxy was about to burn, and she would be the one to light the match. Death came for all in the end, and she would see to it that it arrived sooner than expected</p>
