Persephone stood at the threshold of the shuttle door, inhaling the sterile, filtered air. Closing her eyes, she savored the brief silence—the metal walls muffled the distant screams and pleas from the remnants of Begawa. The calm before the chaos allowed her a moment of clarity.

                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                       
Behind her, the soft thud of armored boots signaled the arrival of her honor guard. They took their positions beside her, their presence both unnecessary and yet reassuring. "It's time, my lady," one of them said, her voice distorted by the helmet's comm system.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      As the ramp lowered, harsh sunlight flooded in, causing Persephone to raise a hand against the glare. The cries outside grew louder, piercing the silence of the shuttle. She stepped forward, her guards flanking her with measured strides.  

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       Her gaze swept over the landscape. The sky of Begawa burned a deep red, streaked with plumes of black smoke rising from the ruins of skyscrapers. She hadn't known the planet before its fall, but the devastation pleased her.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        
Lining the concrete path were survivors—soldiers in tattered uniforms, civilians in ragged clothing—all forced to kneel on the ashen ground. Their faces bore a mix of contempt and resignation. Behind them stood her Sirens, rifles aimed casually at the prisoners' backs. The Sirens, all women, watched without emotion, some with helmets concealing their features, others letting their hair flutter in the acrid breeze.

                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                       As Persephone walked, the living gave way to the dead. Carriers, their eyes vacant, stood in restless silence. Drool escaped from slack jaws, and their fingers twitched with barely restrained hunger. She could feel their primal urge—to tear into warm flesh, to sate an insatiable thirst. It would take only a thought to unleash them upon the survivors, but she held back, savoring the tension.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Reaching the steps leading to her throne, she noted the precise placement—a seat of power framed by the dying light of the setting sun. Purple cushions and gold trim adorned the chair, crafted from the finest materials scavenged from the ruins.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                     Her generals awaited her. Zegana leaned casually against the throne, twirling a pen between her fingers. Her blonde hair partially obscured her face, a habitual gesture that hinted at hidden insecurities. Cyberina stood opposite, her presence projected through a sleek, bio-organic proxy. She was likely multitasking, her true consciousness engaged elsewhere.  

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                     Persephone settled into the throne, exhaling slowly. The murmurs and cries had faded; all eyes were upon her. Resting her chin on her palm, she scanned the crowd. "Where are my prisoners?" she asked, her voice cutting through the silence. "I wanted them here before I sat down. Instead, I see only kneeling mortals and the two of you.   


                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                      Zegana glanced up from her nails. "They'll be here shortly. There were... complications. One had to be dealt with." 

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Persephone arched an eyebrow. "I trust it wasn't the governor. I had plans for him."

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       
"Unfortunately, his daughter," Cyberina interjected, her tone flat. "A Siren shot her, but only in the back."
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Persephone's lips curled into a sly smile. "Well, that saves me the trouble. I had hoped to handle her personally, but no matter."


                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                       As if on cue, the governor appeared at the foot of the steps. His suit hung in tatters, and bruises marred his face. He stumbled forward, forced along by two Sirens. One cradled the limp form of his daughter; the other kept her rifle trained on him.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        
Persephone leaned forward. "Good evening, Governor. Lovely day on Begawa, isn't it?
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                      He knelt before her, his voice barely above a whisper. "You've destroyed everything. My world, my family... What more could you possibly want?" 

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        
She tilted her head thoughtfully. "Oh, not much. Just your daughter." She gestured, and the Siren carrying the girl laid her gently at Persephone's feet.

                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                       The governor's eyes widened. "Leave her be! You've done enough!"


                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        
Ignoring him, Persephone placed her hands over the girl's chest. "They say I only bring death," she mused. "But I can give life, too." A faint glow emanated from her palms.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       The girl's chest rose sharply as she gasped for air. Her eyes fluttered open, confusion clouding them. "Father?" she murmured.


                        
                    </p>
                     <p class="paragraph">
                        
"Tabitha!" The governor's voice cracked as he lunged forward, embracing her. "You're alive!"
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                     She clung to him, tears welling up. "I thought... I thought I was gone."  

                        
                    </p>
                     <p class="paragraph">
                     Persephone watched with detached amusement. "Heartwarming, isn't it?"   

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       Suddenly, the governor stiffened. "Tabitha... I feel... strange." His skin began to pale, wrinkles etching across his face.

                        
                    </p>
                     <p class="paragraph">
                        "Father? What's happening?" Tabitha pulled back, horror dawning as she saw his features wither before her eyes.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                       
He collapsed, his body shriveling into a lifeless husk. Tabitha screamed, scrambling away. "What did you do to him?" she cried, turning to Persephone.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Trembling, Tabitha rose to her feet. "You turned me into a monster!"
</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">"A matter of perspective," Persephone replied smoothly. "You could see it as an opportunity."</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Tabitha's eyes blazed with fury. "I'll kill you for this!" She lunged, grabbing Persephone by the collar.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Persephone met her gaze calmly. "I wouldn't advise that."</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">"Give me one good reason!" Tabitha spat.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Persephone smiled coldly. "Because doing so would seal your fate—and perhaps you'd prefer to live?"</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Tabitha's grip tightened. "You think I care about my own life after what you've done?"</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">"Fair enough." With a swift motion, Persephone headbutted her, sending Tabitha staggering back. Before Tabitha could recover, Persephone flicked her wrist, and an unseen force lifted the girl off her feet, suspending her over the edge of the platform.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Tabitha struggled, green energy crackling around her hands. "I won't let you win!"</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Persephone watched, intrigued. "Show me what you're capable of, then."</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Tabitha unleashed a surge of energy toward the crowds below. Cries rose as several prisoners collapsed, their bodies turning to ash.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Persephone's eyes narrowed. Through her connection with the Sirens, she sensed the disturbance. "Report," she commanded silently.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">"Some prisoners are collapsing, my lady," a Siren's voice echoed in her mind. "Only the humans. We remain unaffected."</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">"Interesting," Persephone thought. "Her abilities only drain the living."</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Tabitha's power flared wildly, but it was unfocused. Persephone sighed. "You have potential, but lack control."</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">"Shut up!" Tabitha screamed, tears mingling with blood from her broken nose. "I'll make you pay!"</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Persephone raised a hand, and Tabitha's energy dissipated. The girl hung helplessly. "Enough of this."</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">She released her hold, and Tabitha crumpled to the ground. A strange disintegration began at her feet, creeping upward. Tabitha looked down, panic flooding her features. "What's happening to me?"</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Persephone turned away. "Consider it a side effect of your gift."</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Tabitha's screams faded as her body dissolved into nothingness, leaving only a pile of empty clothes.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Zegana let out a bored sigh. "Well, that was anticlimactic."
</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Cyberina glanced over. "Predictable outcome."
</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Persephone addressed them without looking back. "Eliminate the rest of the survivors. Burn this planet. It's of no further use to me."</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Her shuttle descended, landing precisely at the edge of the platform. Persephone boarded without a backward glance as explosions rippled across the landscape. The Sirens moved with mechanical efficiency, executing orders.</p>
                     <p class="paragraph">Settling into her seat aboard the shuttle, Persephone gazed out the viewport. "On to the next world," she murmured, as Begawa burned beneath a crimson sky.1</p>
