        Evacuating an entire world on a good day was a herculean task. It demanded fleets of transports, sprawling refugee centers, and volunteers willing to stand as a bulwark against the tsunami of terrified survivors. Success also hinged on the less visible—someone empathetic enough to care about the smallest needs, and stubborn enough to push through a bloated bureaucracy. All of this, of course, assumed a mass evacuation plan even existed, and that it had been rehearsed once or twice a year.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The chaos in front of me screams, shoving, and the stench of panic—shredded all of that to pieces. Desperate hands clawed at the chain-link fences, voices breaking into pleas, faces streaked with tears. Harsh searchlights swept the camp, their beams cutting through the dark, exposing the writhing mass of humanity clawing for escape. And beyond those fences, the fire raged—its heat pressing down, its glow casting everything in hellish light.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Their city was already gone, a collapsing skeleton of glass and steel. In less than a day, their world had become a wasteland. The capital burned, not as a beacon, but as a monument to a monster’s vision. In its streets, the hordes tore through the living—slaughtering, devouring, doing worse things no tongue dared speak.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        It’s no surprise the refugees clawed at the fences to escape. They knew what waited in the ruins, and they had no wish to face its hunger. Unfortunately, the Alliance felt the same way—and so we ended up with this bottleneck. A handful of volunteers tasked with scanning an endless tide of desperate souls for an elusive virus that could slip through even the best nets. Lucky us.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        I pulled out a battered pack of cigarettes and slapped it against my palm until a couple of sticks tumbled free. “Great. Almost out,” I muttered, digging for my lighter. The flint protested, sparking on the third try, before a weak flame sputtered alive. I hunched over it, cupping the glow, the cigarette tip kissing fire. One drag, and I should’ve felt the rush of nicotine. Instead, nothing—just numbness. Yet another perk of being an immortal super soldier. The list of downsides grew longer every damn day.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        You’re probably wondering why I was here. A prestige super soldier, leaning against a wall, cigarette in hand, staring down from what passed as an ivory tower. Truth is, I was wondering the same damn thing. What good is a shock trooper at a refugee checkpoint? Give them a pat on the back? Tell them they’re safe now? Hand them rations that expired weeks ago? Please. I don’t even think Veronica could sell that lie—and I’d seen that ever-optimistic woman pull off the impossible when it came to comforting others.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        A red blinking light on my wrist caught my attention. “Great. What now?” I sighed as gravity took hold of the finished cigarette. Out of instinct, I ground it out beneath my armored boot. I tapped my wrist, and a hologram flared to life—a woman in a rebreather mask.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        “What do you want, Shelly? I’m currently enjoying this scenic tour of hell,” I said, blowing a stray lock of hair from my face.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        “Sardonic as ever, Syriana. A whole world burns, and somehow you still find a way to crack a joke,” Shelly replied. Her voice came through the mask, muffled and flat, but the gist was clear enough.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        “Well, some of us aren’t cooped up in a lab doing God knows what. At least I get the oh-so-lovely perfume of desperation and fire,” I shot back. Shelly flinched. Okay, low blow. The girl hadn’t asked for any of this, and here I was, spotlighting her scars like a searchlight. “Anyway, why are you calling?”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        “They need more bodies down at the gate. The refugees are getting desperate. An idiot conscript let slip that a horde was near and closing fast.” Shelly’s delivery was mechanical, almost thrown away. It never ceased to amaze me how inhuman our kind could sound.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        “So what do you want me to do? Crack skulls? Intimidate people already scared out of their minds? Glare until one of them snaps?” The thought entertained me—pointless, but entertaining. Shelly pressed two fingers to the bridge of her nose and sighed. Obvious enough: some normie general had passed the buck. And she’d been saddled with the job of asking the big bad original to play crowd control. A thankless assignment by definition. I almost pitied her. All she wanted was to run war-crime levels of experiments in peace, and instead she was stuck playing messenger.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        “Fine. I’ll go down and play guard for a while. Could be entertaining.”
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Shelly relaxed at that. I could only imagine the scenarios she’d been running through her head before I answered. She gave a small nod. “Thank you.” Then the hologram flickered out.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        “All righty then. Off to guard duty,” I chuckled, cigarette glowing between my fingers. One last drag, and I headed down into the lovely chaos, bracing myself for the madness I was about to contain.
    </p>
<p style="text-align: center; justify-content: center;">--</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        A lone figure moved through the ruined alleyway. Her body was a map of ruin—skin torn away to reveal raw muscle, her mouth lined with jagged teeth, her tongue too long, too cruel. In her eyes simmered hate and rage, unmistakable and unending. That kind of anger wasn’t natural. She’d long forgotten what had first ignited it, but that hardly mattered anymore. What mattered was finding the humans. The juicy ones.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Just hours ago, there had been millions—wandering, laughing, living without a care. Hell, she had been one of them. Now she was something else. A predator stalking a ghost city, its bones still burning.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        A small part of her screamed in horror at what she’d become, at the carnage she walked through. But that voice was too faint to matter. The other voice—the louder one—demanded blood. And it would be rude to deny either of them.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        She pushed deeper into the alley. Soon, others of her kind appeared. Some still looked almost human. Others matched the nightmares yesterday’s news feeds had shown the world. The irony wasn’t lost on her, but she didn’t care enough to linger on it. The horde swelled around her until it filled the street. Somehow, she had become their leader.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The sweep of a far-off searchlight caught her eye. Humans. Blood. A deep voice rumbled through her skull. She roared, thrusting her arm toward the light, and the horde surged forward at her command.
    </p>
