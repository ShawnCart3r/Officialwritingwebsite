        “Welcome, dearest traveler, to Worlds Away Industries! Our travel agents are here to help you and your family plan your next adventure! Just walk up to a terminal now!” The automated voice rang out, bright and chipper. A hologram flickered into form—a woman in a retro stewardess uniform, her hand resting under her chin in a familiar pose. Veronica smiled at the sight. The look was a throwback to an earlier age, one most people here wouldn’t recognize. It was charming, in a way that only a few travelers might appreciate.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        A little girl nearby tugged at her mother’s sleeve, her face lighting up as she tried to speak with the hologram. Her mother’s laugh, soft but genuine, filled the air. The girl chattered away, captivated by the interaction as the hologram continued its cheerful script. Veronica’s gaze lingered on them. She wondered what the child had seen before this small moment of joy. Weeks of struggle? Months? Perhaps their world had been destroyed in The Great Betrayal, or maybe they had fallen for Persephone’s lies, their leaders selling out their people for power, only to be abandoned.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        She shifted her focus, scanning the crowded terminal. Families sat huddled together, exhaustion etched into their faces. Some stood by the windows, staring into the void of space, while others flicked through data slates, likely searching for news—or escape in the form of cartoons or games. Every now and then, someone glanced at the hologram, but none with the wonder of the child.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The station felt heavy, crowded with the weight of millions of displaced lives. The ship, once a war vessel, now carried them, a vessel for survival rather than conflict.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Veronica moved through the terminal with purpose, unnoticed by most, avoided by those who did notice. Her uniform did enough to make her presence felt. A Shadow’s presence always had that effect. No one dared speak as she passed. The guards scattered around the terminal, undertrained and poorly armed, posed no threat, only there to maintain some semblance of order. Real protection lay with the few combat veterans guarding the wealthier passengers. The Shadow Fleet didn’t waste resources on escorts for ships like this. Not when the war spread them so thin.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        She was here only because the ship’s course matched hers. No need for a special escort. Not now. This ship needed a chief medical officer, and Veronica, head doctor of the Shadows, had the credentials. It gave her a rare moment of respite, a chance to read, maybe catch up on some shows while the rest of the galaxy tore itself apart.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        "Now boarding first class. Please have your tickets and ID ready," the voice over the intercom announced. People rose from their seats, gathering their things and lining up. Veronica passed them with ease. No one protested. Some glanced her way, but the moment they saw the insignia on her sleeve, their eyes dropped. They didn’t need to know who she was—only what she was. Being a Shadow had its benefits.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Her wrist buzzed. She glanced down at the flashing message. Aryanna. A rare smile tugged at her lips. She hadn’t expected a call, least of all from Aryanna. Most of her comrades were busy on distant battlefields, their minds far from hers. Aryanna, though—she was a wild card. On the battlefield, she thrived on attention, always in the thick of the fight. Off-duty, she kept her distance, a strange contradiction that Veronica had always found interesting.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        With a steady step, Veronica moved through the gate. No one stopped her. No one asked for her credentials. The perks of being a Shadow included many things, and anonymity ranked among the best.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The day started like any other. Penny brushed her teeth, did her hair, and painted on her makeup with practiced precision. She buttoned herself into her corporate uniform and stepped out the door. There was just enough time to grab coffee and a donut before work, hopefully sprinkles, because mornings without sprinkles weren’t worth much. She quickened her pace, routine carrying her forward. Same day, same ritual, same Penny.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Her commute was as uneventful as ever. Penny saw the same faces, had the same small talk, and walked the same streets. Nothing ever changed. Same shit, different day—and she liked it that way. Routine was calming. Predictable. Easy. Chaotic lives wore people down and aged them fast, and Penny had no interest in any of that. She just wanted to stay, Penny, and enjoy her simple life.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Penny made it to the office with time to spare. People from all walks of life streamed in around her, all of them worker bees buzzing through their routines. Penny was proud of her little community. Just ordinary people, just getting by. It warmed her heart.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        On the screens, the news anchors droned about the galactic war and its endless escalation. Penny couldn’t bring herself to care. That kind of thing was above her pay grade and far enough away not to matter.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Besides, it was cupcake day, and Martha was bringing in her special recipe. She always brought the best desserts. Nothing could ruin this day. Nothing at all.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Penny was savoring Martha’s cupcake when the first pod hit. The loud pop shook the office. Windows burst. Glass rained down, and blood sprayed across the desks of those too close to the blast. Screams followed, high and raw. Some moaned in shock, others wailed in terror. Penny couldn’t tell which was which. Probably both.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        She looked down at her cupcake and frowned. A shard of glass had landed on the frosting. “My cupcake…” Penny muttered. With a sigh, she tossed it into the trash and tried to gather her bearings. By some stroke of luck, no one seemed dead. Just scratches and cuts—nothing a quick trip to the ER wouldn’t fix.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        She saw a group heading down to see what had caused the ruckus. Against her better judgment, Penny followed. There wasn’t much she could do here anyway; she might as well see for herself.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The entrance doors were blown out. Shards of glass glittered across the lobby floor. People clung to the walls, bloodied and dazed. Some leaned on each other, limping their way around the wreckage.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Penny crossed the room, curiosity getting the better of her. Sirens wailed outside. People were shouting. Whatever caused this mess was out there, and Penny just had to see it.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Outside was worse. People stumbled through the street, milling aimlessly, voices rising in confusion. Concrete lay cracked, chunks of debris scattered like dice. Whatever had come down hit with brutal force.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Then she saw it. The wreck was half-buried, jagged metal jutting through the street. People pressed close, hands on the hull, trying to pry it open. “Uh, guys, I wouldn’t—” Penny called out, reason clawing its way past her curiosity at last.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The air vibrated with a harsh, mechanical grind. With a snap, the pod’s shell split open. Gas hissed from the seams. The onlookers jerked back, eyes wide, hands flying away as if burned.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        For a few seconds, there was only silence. Then the screaming began.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Penny turned. A man in a suit was on top of another, his teeth buried in the man’s throat. The scream died into a wet gargle. Blood smeared the attacker’s mouth as his victim slumped to the ground, drowning in his own blood.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Penny froze, shock pinning her in place. Around her, the street dissolved into chaos. Two women lunged at a man, dragging him down. His scream rose, shrill and hopeless, before they ripped him apart. The sound shook Penny to her core.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        A woman staggered up to Penny. Her clothes were shredded, her wounds raw and bleeding. She gripped Penny’s shoulder with shaking hands. “Please—help me!” she cried. Penny stood rooted in place, fear locking her body, no words coming.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Gunfire erupted, sharp and final. Emergency services surged into the street, weapons up, moving with brutal precision. Penny saw a plain-clothed officer cut down two snarling attackers. Not a soldier, just a cop. But it was enough, for now.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        “Ma’am, it’s going to be all rig—” The words died as the woman beside Penny lunged with a guttural roar. Her teeth sank into the cop’s face, tearing away flesh in a spray of blood. Warm drops splashed across Penny’s skin, speckling her eyes and mouth.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        “Motherfucker!” the cop roared, unloading round after round. The woman convulsed under the barrage, twitching violently before collapsing in a twitching heap.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The officer touched his ruined face, fingers slick with blood. He went pale, his eyes empty. “Oh god,” he muttered, voice breaking. He staggered back, weapon slipping from his hand. Penny reached out, but the sound of chaos outside swallowed her words.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Penny blinked hard. Something was wrong. Her legs faltered, the world tilting as sound crashed in—every scream, every shout, deafening. Her chest burned. And then the rage came, flooding through her veins. Not foreign. Not strange. It felt natural. It felt like her.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Penny saw red. Heat roared through her chest, her skin burning. A fury she hadn’t known existed boiled to the surface, drowning out thought. “What’s happening?!” she choked. Her body convulsed, stiffening, seizing as the change began.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Her scream twisted into something inhuman, a roar that rattled the street. Penny was gone—snuffed out in an instant by The Nightmaric Virus. What remained was no one. No name. No memory. Just a thing, teeth bared, rage made flesh.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        It staggered forward into the chaos, indistinguishable from the swarm.
    </p>
<p style="text-align: center; justify-content: center;">--</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The creature and the horde closed in on the stragglers. Fear rolled off them in waves, sweet and sharp on its tongue. Soon it would drink their screams, bathe in their blood. The worthy few would be remade, bound to its hunger.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        It roared, arm raised, and the horde thundered forward.
    </p>
